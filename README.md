## 1. What does the single responsibility principle consist of? What's its purpose?

The **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** is one of the five SOLID principles of object-oriented design. It states that a class should have only one reason to change, meaning that it should have only one responsibility or function. Each class or module should focus on doing one thing well. 

### Purpose
The purpose of the SRP is to create more maintainable, understandable, and robust software. When each class is responsible for only one concern or functionality, it becomes easier to:
- Test: Small, well-defined classes are easier to test in isolation.
- Modify: Changes in one part of the system do not impact other unrelated areas.
- Reuse: Code with a single responsibility is easier to reuse in different contexts.
- Understand: Developers can quickly grasp the purpose of a class or function when it focuses on a single task.

## 2. What characteristics does, in your opinion, a “good” code or clean code have?

In my opinion, **clean code** exhibits the following characteristics:

1. **Readability**: Code should be easy to read and understand by others. Descriptive variable names, methods, and classes make the code self-explanatory.
2. **Simplicity**: Keep the code as simple as possible, avoiding unnecessary complexity. Simplicity allows for easier debugging and modification.
3. **Modularity**: Code should be organized in well-defined, reusable modules or classes. Each module should serve a clear purpose and follow the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).
4. **Consistency**: Code should follow consistent formatting and naming conventions, which helps to make the entire codebase predictable and easier to navigate.
5. **Testability**: A good code structure should make testing straightforward. Functions and classes that follow SRP are easier to test.
6. **Minimal Duplication**: Avoid repeating code by abstracting common functionality into reusable components. This reduces the risk of errors and simplifies maintenance.
7. **Efficient**: While performance isn't the only priority, clean code should consider time and space efficiency when necessary.
8. **Error Handling**: Clean code anticipates potential errors and handles exceptions gracefully without crashing or leading to undefined states.

## 3. Detail how you would do everything that you have not completed.

If there are any unfinished tasks or incomplete functionality in the challenge, I would proceed as follows:

1. **Evaluate the Missing Parts**: First, I would review any remaining functionality or features to assess their scope and requirements.
  
2. **Plan the Implementation**:
   - **Prioritize**: Based on the time remaining and complexity, I would prioritize the most critical parts, ensuring the core functionalities are fully operational.
   - **Break it Down**: Divide the remaining work into smaller, manageable tasks or components. This ensures progress is measurable and easier to track.

3. **Follow Good Development Practices**:
   - I would continue adhering to the principles of clean code, modularity, and the Single Responsibility Principle.
   - Implement tests where applicable to ensure the robustness of new additions.
   
4. **Specific Tasks**:
   - **If I haven’t completed all API calls**: I would ensure that the remaining API endpoints are integrated following the structure and design of the current working API code.
   - **UI or UX Work**: Ensure that any remaining UI elements are properly styled and responsive, adhering to design patterns established in the app.
   - **Feature Additions**: Add any missing features such as animations, transitions, or additional business logic, ensuring they don’t disrupt existing functionality.
   
5. **Testing**:
   - Conduct comprehensive testing of both new and existing features to ensure they function correctly and efficiently.
   - Handle edge cases, including error handling and testing for various input scenarios.

6. **Document the Work**: 
   - Update the README file with any important details about how the new code works or how certain issues were resolved. 
   - Add comments in the codebase to explain complex logic or reasoning behind certain design decisions.

7. **Final Review**:
   - Conduct a final review of the project, refactoring any redundant or overly complex code and ensuring that the code adheres to clean code principles.
